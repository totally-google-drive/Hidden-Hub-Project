# Hidden-Hub-Project

This is a website that cloaks almost all websites.

This website uses about:blank Cloaking.


There is a password to the website (if you really put in the time to self host)
you can find the password in the source code.
It was meant to hide the password from people who do not have access to the inspect part of a web browser (that is why its so unprotected)

yeah that is it.
