# Hidden-Hub-Project

This is a website with multiple links to different sites.

This website uses about:blank Cloaking.


There is a password to the website
you can find the password in the source code.
It was meant to hide the password from people who do not have access to the inspect part of a web browser (that is why its so unprotected)
working on a backend verification.

yeah that is it.
